## The original table

The code reproduces the original table and some calculations in the original paper.

### Original data

```{r}
#sequence length (this is NOT m*n)
mn          <- c(191,245,314,403,518,665,854,1097,1408,1808,2322,2981)

# mean length of alignments
l.orig      <- c(22.6 ,25.8 ,29.4, 32.4,36.3,40.3,43.9,48.1,51.6,55.1,59.1,63.5)

# log(m*n)
## this is the log of the search space
## eg log(search space)
ln.n.m.     <- c(10.25, 10.78,11.30,11.83,12.35,12.87,13.39,13.91,14.43,14.94,15.45,15.96)

# u (mu)
u.orig      <- c(26.45,28.31,30.21,32.04,33.92,35.94,37.84,39.75,41.71,43.54,45.53,47.32)


# lambda
lambda.orig <- c(0.298,0.286,0.282,0.275,0.279,0.273,0.272,0.275,0.268,0.271,0.267,0.270)

# K
K.orig      <- c(0.073,0.055,0.051,0.041,0.048,0.041,0.040,0.046,0.036,0.041,0.035,0.040)

```


### Create table

```{r}
table1 <- data.frame(mn = mn,
                     l = l.orig,
           ln.nm = round(log(mn*mn),3),
           ln.n.m.,
           u = u.orig,
           lambda = lambda.orig,
           K = K.orig)
```

Look at the table

```{r}
table1
```


## Save the table

```{r}
table1 <- write.csv(table1,file = "table1.csv")
```


```{r}

```
